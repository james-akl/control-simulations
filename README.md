# Robot Control Simulations

This project explores different control schemes that are formulated, implemented, and simulated.

[Project Page](https://jamesakl.com/control-simulations/)

These specific control schemes are studied:

* Luenberger State Observer with Feedback Control
* Robot PD Control and Computed–Torque Control
* Model–Reference Adaptive Control

The project page details the methodology, mathematical formulation, simulation, and results.

The project simulations have been implemented using MATLAB/Simulink.
